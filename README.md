Below is a complete Python program that implements the end-to-end AI voice assistance pipeline, including detailed descriptions of each part and expected outputs. This program will cover the following steps:
1.	Voice-to-Text Conversion using the Whisper model.
2.	Text Processing with a Large Language Model (LLM) using Hugging Face Transformers.
3.	Text-to-Speech Conversion using Edge TTS.

def get_llm_response(input_text):
    """
    Generates a response from a Large Language Model (LLM) based on input text.

# Run the program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    audio_file_path = "path_to_your_audio_file.wav"  # Replace with your audio file path
    asyncio.run(main(audio_file_path))

Description of Each Step

1.	Voice-to-Text Conversion:
o	The audio_to_text function uses the Whisper model to transcribe audio input into text. It takes the path to an audio file as input and returns the transcribed text.
2.	Text Processing with LLM:
o	The get_llm_response function takes the transcribed text and generates a response using a pre-trained LLM (GPT-2 in this case). It returns the generated text response.
3.	Text-to-Speech Conversion:
o	The text_to_speech function converts the generated text response back into speech using the Edge TTS library. It saves the output as an audio file (MP3 format).
4.	Main Function:
o	The main function orchestrates the entire process, calling each step in sequence and printing the outputs.
Expected Output
When you run the program with a valid audio file, you can expect the following output in the console:
Converting audio to text...
Transcribed Text: Hello, how can I help you today?
Generating response from LLM...
LLM Response: I'm here to assist you with any questions you may have.
Converting response to speech...
Audio response saved to output_audio.mp3

Notes
•	Audio File: Make sure to replace "path_to_your_audio_file.wav" with the actual path to your audio file.
•	Dependencies: Ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
•	pip install whisper transformers edge-tts
•	Model Size: The Whisper model size can be adjusted based on your needs (e.g., "small", "medium", "large"). The larger the model, the better the accuracy but also the more resources it will require.
Conclusion
This complete program provides a functional implementation of an AI voice assistance pipeline. You can further enhance it by adding features like Voice Activity Detection (VAD) and latency minimization techniques as required in your assignment. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
